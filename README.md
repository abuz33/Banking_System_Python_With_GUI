In this system banking application when users enter the system they will be able to create an account. After creating an account, they will be able to deposit or withfraw money from their account. All of these transactions will be stored in file system. Whenever they wanted to view their transactions, they can check the data. Furthermore, they will be able to send or recieve money. 

If any data has been changed during having an account, in our system, they can review their information and change it whenever they wish.

If the user doesn't like or need or etc cases, he or she can delete the account.
