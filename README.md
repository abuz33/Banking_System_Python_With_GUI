# Banking_System_Python_With_GUI

In this project we create a new Graphical User Interface for a banking system. A user is going to be able to create a user account and send and recieve money and many more abilities.

IN USER CASES:
The user can;
-- create an account,
-- log in the account (Extend:  if the typed info is not correct, van not log in.),
-- deposit an amount money,
-- view the account en the balance,
-- withdraw an amount of money,
-- edit the personel details,
-- send money, (extend: if the reciever info correct is)
-- delete the account.

We have two classes: 
-- "User" is the parent class.
-- "Bank account is the child class."

We will gather the data in text files.
